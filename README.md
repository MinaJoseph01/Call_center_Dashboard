## Project Overview

I'm excited to share my latest project: a comprehensive call center dashboard that provides real-time visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs). This dashboard empowers call center managers and agents to optimize operations, enhance customer experience, and boost agent performance.

## Key Features

### Monitor Call Volume
- **Objective**: Gain a clear understanding of total calls received per day, state, reason for contact, and channel used.
- **Details**: Helps identify peak call times and resource allocation needs.
- **Visualization**: Total calls per day, state, reason, and channel.

### Track Call Duration
- **Objective**: Analyze call duration by both minutes and hours.
- **Details**: Optimizes agent training and identifies areas for streamlining call handling.
- **Visualization**: Call duration per minute and hour.

### Measure Service Level Agreement (SLA) Adherence
- **Objective**: See the percentage of calls where response times meet or exceed the SLA.
- **Details**: Facilitates proactive adjustments to ensure timely customer service.
- **Visualization**: Response time percentage within or above SLA.

### Drill Down for Granular Insights
- **Objective**: Allow deeper dives into specific geographic regions (cities) and contact outcomes (COAs).
- **Details**: Uncovers potential location-based trends and identifies areas for improvement.
- **Visualization**: Total COAs per city.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Power Query**: For data manipulation and preparation.
- **Data Analysis**: To derive actionable insights from the data.

## Customization and Integration
- The dashboard is designed for customization to meet specific call center needs.
- Potential for integration with other call center systems to provide a holistic view of operations.

## Challenges Addressed
- **Data Integration**: Consolidated data from multiple sources to provide a unified view.
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensured the dashboard provides real-time visibility into call center KPIs.
- **User-friendly Design**: Focused on creating an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Unique Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Allows users to filter data by various parameters for detailed analysis.
- **Geographic Insights**: Provides a visual representation of call center performance across different regions.
- **Custom Metrics**: Tailored metrics to track and improve specific aspects of call center operations.
